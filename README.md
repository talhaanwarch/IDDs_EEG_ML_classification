# IDDs_EEG_ML_classification
A Machine Learning approach for Recognizing Intellectual Development Disorder using EEG

# Abstract
Intellectual   development   disorder   (IDD)   is   char-acterized  by  below  average  mental  capabilities  of  individualsand   affects   intellectual,   physical,   behavioural   and   emotionaldevelopment. It mainly occurs in children of developing countrieswhere health and nutritional requirements are questionable. Thispaper  presents  a  machine  learning  classification  approach  todiagnose  individuals  suffering  from  IDD.  Electroencephalogram(EEG)  is  used  to  capture  information  from  the  subject  brain  inthe form of signals and processed further to diagnose the disorder.Data collected from 14 subjects (7 control and 7 disease affected)is  used  in  this  study.  Signals  are  captured  in  rest  condition  andwhen subjects are listening to music. Discrete wavelet transform(DWT)  features  are  extracted  from  these  EEG  signals.  Thesefeatures  are  used  by  machine  learning  classifier  to  identify  thedisorder. Accuracy of 92.6% and 91.3% is achieved when subjectsare  listening  to  music  and  without  music,  respectively
